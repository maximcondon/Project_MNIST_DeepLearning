    "# Transfer Learning \n",
    "We're going to look at it in the context of image processing!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transfer Learning means reusing an already trained network for a similar purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of transfer learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- you can reuse pre-trained networks\n",
    "- it saves lots of training time\n",
    "- it allows you to train with very small training datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## There are three strategies to reuse a pretrained network:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use intermediate output \n",
    "- Use the intermediate output of one network layer (e.g. the last fully connected layer before the output). \n",
    "- Use the output as input for a conventional Machine Learning model (e.g. a SVM). \n",
    "- This approach is successfully used for image classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partial Retraining\n",
    "- If you exchange the last layers of the network (e.g. change the number of output classes), you can retrain the network for a slightly different purpose. For instance we could re-train a CNN that recognizes cats to recognize foxes instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Of course, the first layers for which you want to use the pre-trained weights need to be exactly the same, otherwise the number of parameters wonâ€™t match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOU FREEZE THE EARLIER LAYERS!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combine the pretrained network\n",
    "- If you remove the output layer you can put other layers or other networks on top of it. For instance, combining a pretrained CNN with an LSTM would allow you to train a network that produces image captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frozen Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "In transfer learning, the weights of the first layers are usually fixed. Only the last layers are trainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To freeze a layer in a Keras model, set `layer.trainable = False`. To freeze layers of an already existing model try accessing the trainable attribute via `model.layers`:"

To prevent this gradient from distorting the pretrained weights, there are usually a few warmup epochs where the pretrained layers are completely frozen and the new layers adjust to them. Only after that the real training begins."
